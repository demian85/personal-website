# My personal website

This is basically my CV. You can easily export this Web as PDF using the native browser printing functionality (Command or Ctrl + P).

I took the design from a free CV maker website and decided to build it from scratch using React + JSX + ES6 + Babel + Webpack + Eslint.... Well, I can keep naming development tools forever!
