# My personal website

You can check it out: http://demianrodriguez.ninja/

This is basically my CV. You can easily export this Web as PDF using the native browser printing functionality (Command or Ctrl + P).

I took the design from a free CV maker website and decided to build it from scratch using React + CSS + JSX + ES6 + Babel + Webpack + Eslint.... Well, I can keep naming development tools and technologies forever!

Obviously, this master branch's history has been deleted to hide personal information that's not there anymore :P
